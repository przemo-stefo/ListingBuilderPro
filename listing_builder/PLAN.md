# LinkedIn Outreach Automation System

## Current State (PYROX pipeline - already built & active)

5 active n8n workflows forming a Scrape-Score-Send pipeline:
- `[PYROX] Lead Generation - EU Decision Makers` - LinkedIn scrape → Groq filter → email finder → cold email via Brevo
- `[PYROX] Batch Lead Pipeline - CSV Import` - bulk processing
- `[PYROX] Lead Enrichment - Scrape & Summarize` - company website scrape → Groq summary
- `[PYROX] AI Personalization - About Us` - deep website research → personalized outreach
- `[PYROX] AI Sales Agent - Full Pipeline` - qualify → enrich → AI proposal → Gmail send

**Problem:** Currently PYROX only sends cold emails. LinkedIn is untouched for outreach and content. No content marketing happening at all.

## What We're Building

A 3-part system that makes LinkedIn generate leads on autopilot:

### PART 1: LinkedIn Content Engine (daily posts)
**New n8n workflow:** `[LINKEDIN] Daily Content Engine - PL/EN`

**Flow:**
```
Cron (daily 9:00 AM)
  → Groq generates post topic (rotating categories)
  → AI writes 2 posts: Polish + English
  → LinkedIn API publishes directly
  → Logs post + engagement tracking
```

**Post categories (rotating weekly):**
1. Monday: Industry insight / trend ("AI automation saved X hours for...")
2. Tuesday: Mini case study ("How we automated invoice processing for...")
3. Wednesday: Tip / how-to ("3 signs your business needs AI automation")
4. Thursday: Behind-the-scenes ("Building an AI agent this week...")
5. Friday: Results / social proof ("This week's automation wins...")

**Two markets:**
- PL posts → automatyzacja-ai.pl positioning, PLN pricing
- EN posts → EU/international, USD pricing

**Requires:** LinkedIn OAuth2 credentials configured in n8n

### PART 2: LinkedIn Outreach Pipeline (Phantombuster + n8n)
**New n8n workflow:** `[LINKEDIN] Outreach Pipeline - Auto Connect & Message`

**Flow:**
```
Cron (daily 10:00 AM)
  → Launch Phantombuster "Sales Navigator Search"
    (target: business owners, CTOs, operations managers)
  → Get results → filter by PYROX scoring
  → For qualified leads:
    → Scrape company website (reuse PYROX Enrichment)
    → AI generates personalized connection note (max 300 chars)
    → Launch Phantombuster "LinkedIn Auto Connect"
  → Track in leads database

Cron (daily 14:00 PM) - Follow-ups
  → Check connections accepted (last 24h)
  → For new connections:
    → AI generates follow-up message (personalized, value-first)
    → Launch Phantombuster "LinkedIn Message Sender"
  → Log message sent + timestamp
```

**Safety limits (avoid LinkedIn ban):**
- Max 20 connection requests/day
- Max 30 messages/day
- Random delays 60-180s between actions
- No outreach on weekends
- Warm-up period: week 1 = 10/day, week 2 = 15/day, week 3+ = 20/day

**Target profiles:**
- PL market: Polish SME owners, marketing managers, operations directors
- EN market: EU CTOs, CIOs, COOs at companies 50-500 employees

**Requires:** Phantombuster account ($69/mo Growth plan = 5 slots)

### PART 3: Message Templates + Follow-up Sequences
**Extend existing workflow:** `[PYROX] AI Personalization - About Us`

**3-message sequence:**

**Message 1 (Connection note - 300 chars max):**
```
Hi {name}, saw your work at {company} - impressive {specific_detail}.
I help companies like yours save 10-20h/week with AI automation.
Would love to connect and share insights!
```

**Message 2 (Day 1 after accept - value message):**
```
Thanks for connecting {name}!
I noticed {company} handles {pain_point_from_website}.
We recently helped a similar company automate that - cut their time by 60%.
Here's a quick case study: {link}
Happy to chat if you're curious.
```

**Message 3 (Day 5 - soft CTA):**
```
Quick thought {name} - based on what I see at {company},
the biggest quick win would be automating {specific_process}.
Want me to show you a 2-min demo? No strings attached.
```

All messages generated by Groq with personalization from company website scrape.
